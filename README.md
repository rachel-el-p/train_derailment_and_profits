# Data Studio Project 4: [Train Derailments and Profits](https://rachel-el-p.github.io/train_derailment_and_profits/)

This is my submission for the Data Studio class' fourth assignment.

The Norfolk Southern train crash in East Palestine, Ohio has been generating a lot of news, and my interest was piqued having interviewed rail workers last year ahead of their planned strike. My plan was to look at how many train derailments there have been, and how much profits the large rail companies had been making, and their stock prices. It seemed they weren't being punished financially even though accidents had been happening continously. 

I looked at data on rail accidents from the Federal Railroad Administration, and filtered it just for Class I railroads, and derailments that happened between 2018 and 2022. I also looked at the earnings reports filed by the railroad companies for their profits, and downloaded the monthly closing share price data from Yahoo! Finance.

I also took data on the miles each Class I railroad traveled between 2018 and 2022 to calculate the number of derailments per million miles traveled, since every railroad is of a different size. I didn't end up using the information, but you can take a look at my analysis on my jupyter notebook scratchpad in my notebooks folder.

I used Pandas to do my analysis, and R/Ggplot to make my charts. To make the radar-like chart, I used Rawgraphs' template and modified it in Adobe Illustrator.

## Skills learned: 
I did much more analysis work with pandas and R/Ggplot.  

## Things I would've liked to do:
I want to work on the radar chart next by turning it into a scrollytelling piece.
